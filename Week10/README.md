# DA108 | Lab 10 Assignment

One of the ways to learn drawing is by drawing an object you are seeing or have seen in the past. We recommend a similar approach to learn plotting in python. That is, to use Python and replicate an existing plot you have seen.

## [Task A](Effective_Matplotlib.ipynb)

Go through the tutorial at : [pbpython.com/effective-matplotlib.html](https://pbpython.com/effective-matplotlib.html). It is an insightful tutorial which will help you appreciate the ease and beauty of plotting data using matplotlib in Python. We recommend you replicate the code given in the tutorial in your local system as well.

## [Task B](Examples_Matplotlib.ipynb)

Go through at least five plots from the examples repository provided at and replicate them in your local system. Link: [matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html)
